# McEliece Instance Generator

**Disclaimer**: This package is for research and testing purposes only. 
It is not to be used for encrypting sensitive data.

The Python application `genmci` generates random McEliece and Niederreider problem 
instances with Goppa codes, consisting of a public key binary matrix and a ciphertext binary vector.
The problem instances can be generated for any code size `n` and minimum error correction distance `t`.

An MCI problem instance consists of a binary matrix G and a ciphertext binary vector y.
The solution to each instance is a plaintext binary vector x such that the objective function  $L(x) = ||y - Gx||_1$  is minimized.
        
Equivalently a McEliece-Niederreiter Cryptographic Instance (MNCI) consists of a binary matrix H 
and a binary vector s. The solution to each instance is a binary vector y of minimum Hamming weight 
(or known Hamming weight t) such that  s = H y. 
MCI can be reduced to MNCI and vice-versa. They are equivalent formulations of the linear decoding problem,
which is NP-complete in general.
        
Each instance is split into public and private sets of files.
    Private:
        - The message that was encoded (plain.txt)
        - The Goppa code used for encoding (goppa.yml)
        - The random matrices of the McEliece protocol (.priv.txt)
    Public:
        - The encoded message (cipher.txt)
        - The public key matrix (pub.txt)
        - The native decoding problem in MLD (i.e. p-spin) format (mld.txt)
        - The native decoding problem in XOR-extension DIMACS format (xor.cnf)
        - The decoding problem reduced to 3-SAT in DIMACS format (3sat.cnf)
        
* Maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) format *
The MLD problem is specified as follows: Given an M x N matrix H, an M-vector y, and a positive integer w, 
find the N-vector x such that
            Hx = y (mod 2)
subject to the constraint  |x| <= w (or |x| = w)

The MLD file format describes either a MLD or PCD problem using a CNF-like specification, where
each line describes a row of the linear equation over F2.
The overall format is summarized as follows:
```txt
     (g|h) N M y w
     1 2 3 4
    -2 3 4 5
     ...
```

How to install
---

The easiest way to install `genmci` is using `pip`:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/nasa/pysa@pysa-mceliece
```

MLD file format
----

The MLD file format describes a maximum likelihood decoding problem using a CNF-like specification, where each line describes a row of the linear equation over $\mathbb{F}_2$. The overall format is summarized as follows:

```txt
(g|h) N M y w
 1 2 3 4
-2 3 4 5
...
```

The first line is a header with the following data:

- A single character, `g` or `h`
      - If `g`, the file describes the $n\times k$ generator matrix transpose for a $[n, k]$ code with `M = n` clauses and `N = k` variables.
      - If `h`, the file describes the parity check matrix for a $[n, k]$ code with `M = n-k` clauses and `N = n` variables.
      - The characters `p` and `w` are reserved.
- `N` Number of column variables.
- `M` Number of rows, i.e. clauses.
- `y = (0|1)` Sets the boolean assignment for each row to either false (`0`) or true (`1`).
- `w` Hamming weight of the code space error.
      - `w > 0` Hamming weight is exactly `w`
      - `w == 0` Hamming weight is not specified
      - `w < 0` Hamming weight is at most `|w|`

Lines 2 through `M+1` specify the non-zero elements of the matrix using 1-based indices (1 to `N`). If an integer is negative, then $y_i$ is negated to $(1 - y_i)$.

As an example, the Niederreiter instances contain the header `h n M 1 t`, where `M=n-k` and `t` is the error correction distance of the Goppa decoder. Negated lines correspond to rows where $y_i = 0$, and other lines correspond to rows where $y_i = 1$.

*p*-spin Hamiltonian Ground State
----

A *p*-spin Hamiltonian over $k$ variables has the form

$$ H = -\sum_{i=1}^N J_i \sigma_{i_1} \ldots \sigma_{i_p}.  $$

When $J_i=\pm 1$, the problem of finding the ground state of this Hamiltonian can be reduced to a maximum likelihood decoding problem.
