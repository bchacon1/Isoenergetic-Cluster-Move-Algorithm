Stern Algorithm Solver
======================

Installation
----

`sternx` runs the Stern algorithm to solve unstructured decoding and *p*-spin
Hamiltonian ground states.

Requirements: C++17 and Fortran compilers (such as gcc and gfortran) and Boost.
Optionally, the program can be built with an MPI compiler.

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. 
make sternx
```

To compile with MPI support, run cmake with the definition `cmake -DMPI ..`.

Input file format
----

The MLD file format describes a maximum likelihood decoding problem using a
CNF-like specification, where each line describes a row of the linear equation
over $\mathbb{F}_2$. The overall format is summarized as follows:

```txt
(g|h) N M y w
 1 2 3 4
-2 3 4 5
...
```

The first line is a header with the following data:

- A single character, `g` or `h`
      - If `g`, the file describes the $n\times k$ generator matrix transpose
        for a $[n, k]$ code with `M = n` clauses and `N = k` variables.
      - If `h`, the file describes the parity check matrix for a $[n, k]$ code
        with `M = n-k` clauses and `N = n` variables.
      - The characters `p` and `w` are reserved.
- `N` Number of column variables.
- `M` Number of rows, i.e. clauses.
- `y = (0|1)` Sets the boolean assignment for each row to either false (`0`) or
  true (`1`).
- `w` Hamming weight of the code space error.
      - `w > 0` Hamming weight is exactly `w`
      - `w == 0` Hamming weight is not specified
      - `w < 0` Hamming weight is at most `|w|`

Lines 2 through `M+1` specify the non-zero elements of the matrix using 1-based
indices (1 to `N`). If an integer is negative, then $y_i$ is negated to $(1 -
y_i)$.

As an example, the Niederreiter instances contain the header `h n M 1 t`, where
`M=n-k` and `t` is the error correction distance of the Goppa decoder. Negated
lines correspond to rows where $y_i = 0$, and other lines correspond to rows
where $y_i = 1$.

*p*-spin Hamiltonian Ground State
----

A *p*-spin Hamiltonian over $k$ variables has the general form

$$ H = -\sum_{i=1}^N J_i \sigma_{i_1} \ldots \sigma_{i_p}. $$

When $J_i=\pm 1$, the problem of finding the ground state of this Hamiltonian
can be reduced to a maximum likelihood decoding problem. The Stern algorithm
can be generalized to  handle $p$-spin problems with arbitrary couplings as
well.
