libMLD
======

C++ library for reading and processing maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) problems.

The MLD file format describes a maximum likelihood decoding problem using a
CNF-like specification, where each line describes a row of the linear equation
over $\mathbb{F}_2$. The overall format is summarized as follows:

```txt
(g|h) N M y w
 1 2 3 4
-2 3 4 5
...
```

The first line is a header with the following data:

- A single character, `g` or `h`
  - If `g`, the file describes the $n\times k$ generator matrix transpose for a
    $[n, k]$ code with `M = n` clauses and `N = k` variables.
  - If `h`, the file describes the parity check matrix for a $[n, k]$ code with
    `M = n-k` clauses and `N = n` variables.
  - The characters `p` and `w` are reserved.
- `N` Number of column variables.
- `M` Number of rows, i.e. clauses.
- `y = (0|1)` Sets the boolean assignment for each row to either false (`0`) or
  true (`1`).
- `w` Hamming weight of the code space error.
  - `w > 0` Hamming weight is exactly `w`
  - `w == 0` Hamming weight is not specified
  - `w < 0` Hamming weight is at most `|w|`

Lines 2 through `M+1` specify the non-zero elements of the matrix using 1-based
indices (1 to `N`). If an integer is negative, then $y_i$ is negated to $(1 -
y_i)$.
